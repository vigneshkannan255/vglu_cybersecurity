# Introduction to Cyber Security

What is Cyber Security?

Cyber security refers to the body of technologies, processes,  and practices designed to protect networks, devices,  programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized  access.


Security:	We must protect our computers and data in the  same way that we secure the doors to our homes.
Safety:	We must behave in ways that protect us against risks  and threats that come with technology.
